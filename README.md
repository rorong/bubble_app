The bubble.io interface allows users to interact with this backend, performing operations on products and inventory through a visual, no-code environment.

2. **What's new ->** Bubble.io is a no-code platform that allows users to create web applications without having to write code. It provides a visual interface where users can design the user interface and define the logic of their applications through a graphical interface.
This API serves as the backend, handling data operations related to inventory and products. This includes but is not limited to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
The communication between the bubble.io interface and your Rails API is likely based on HTTP requests. Bubble.io sends requests to the API endpoints exposed by your Rails application, and the Rails API processes these requests, executing the necessary logic and returning the appropriate response
